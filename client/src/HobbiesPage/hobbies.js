            Really just placeholder text...pretty meaningless but read if you
            please...This part of the page is all about my hobbies and
            interests! As mentioned before, I love music and computers so
            naturally I love rock and roll and video games. Right around the
            same age as I was introduced to music and our computer I also found
            Black Sabbath and video games throughtout the web. Would just like
            to state on record that Black Sabbath rules! Now that I got that out
            of my system; I found small games on Miniclip quite entertaining and
            as my palate evolved I grew more fond of Multiplayer games. I have
            been gaming, playing music live, creating both online communities
            and safe spaces for both since I was a teenager. Any time I wasn't
            practicing with my band or working, I was monitoring my Discord(was
            Vent or Teamspeak at the time) group and helping people with
            whatever they needed. As I grew older and wiser, I realized that
            these online communites really made a difference even though I was
            promised otherwise.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            If it wasn't for FaceBook networking I would've never been able to
            tour and play music. Yes, a lot of those tours and shows were DYI
            but the internet made connecting with other promoters around the
            world so much easier. Technology outgrew the scope of people's
            reality, when I was fourteen, no one thought Esports would be a
            thing or streaming/ content creating would be a full-time career.
            When I told my parents I was going to go tour in Europe in 15
            different countries over the summer they thought I was nuts! As
            people grow more comfortable with online communites and socializing
            over the internet, it will become increasingly more evident how much
            information and opportunity is available to everyone.{" "}
